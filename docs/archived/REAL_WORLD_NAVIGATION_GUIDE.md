## 📊 Performance Tiers

### 🟢 **Excellent (< 300ms)** - Real-time Apps
- ✅ **Highway Avoidance**: 94-337ms (varies by route complexity)
- ✅ **Perturbation**: 130ms (consistent performance)
- ✅ **Adaptive**: 229ms (intelligent selection)
- ✅ **Fast Exclusion**: 218-253ms (reliable multi-stop)

### 🟡 **Very Good (300-500ms)** - Mobile Apps
- ✅ **Plateau Method**: ~491ms (traditional approach)
- ✅ **Progressive Penalty**: ~496ms (balanced performance)

### 🟠 **Good (500-800ms)** - Background Processing
- ⚠️ **Major Edge Exclusion**: ~600ms (comprehensive analysis)

## 🎯 Demo App Configuration

### Frontend Algorithm Selection
```javascript
// Recommended algorithm mapping for demo app
const algorithmMapping = {
  'daily_commute': 'adaptive',
  'ride_hailing': 'highway', 
  'logistics': 'fast',
  'cycling': 'highway',
  'walking': 'perturbation',
  'public_transport': 'adaptive',
