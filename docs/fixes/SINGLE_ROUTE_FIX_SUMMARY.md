# Single Route API Fix Summary

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**

When users unchecked the "Show Alternative Routes" checkbox, the demo app correctly cleared previous routes but then failed to generate new routes using the single route API (`/api/route`), resulting in 404 "No route found" errors.

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

The issue was **API inconsistency**:

### **Alternative Routes API** (`/api/route/alternatives`) ✅
- Uses `router_instance.alternative_routes()` method
- Works reliably with the enhanced adaptive algorithm
- Handles routing errors gracefully

### **Single Route API** (`/api/route`) ❌  
- Uses `router_instance.route()` method
- More complex error handling and validation
- Fails on the same coordinates that work with alternative routes API
- Different underlying routing approach

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **Unified Routing Approach**
Modified the single route API to use the **same underlying routing engine** as the alternative routes API:

```python
# OLD APPROACH (Failed)
route = router_instance.route(
    start=(start[0], start[1]),
    end=(end[0], end[1]),
    profile=profile
)

# NEW APPROACH (Fixed)
multi_route_response = router_instance.alternative_routes(
    start=(start[0], start[1]),
    end=(end[0], end[1]),
    num_alternatives=1,  # Just get the optimal route
    method="adaptive",   # Use our enhanced adaptive method
    profile=profile,
    diversity_preference=0.0  # Focus on optimal route only
)

# Extract the optimal route from the response
route = SingleRouteWrapper(multi_route_response.optimal_route)
```

### **Key Benefits**

1. **Consistency**: Both single and alternative routes use the same routing engine
2. **Reliability**: Uses the proven `alternative_routes()` method that works
3. **Enhanced Algorithm**: Single routes now use the enhanced adaptive algorithm
4. **Fallback**: Still falls back to original `route()` method if needed
5. **Compatibility**: Maintains the same API response format

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **SingleRouteWrapper Class**
Created a wrapper class to maintain API compatibility:

```python
class SingleRouteWrapper:
    def __init__(self, optimal_route):
        self.distance_km = optimal_route.distance_km
        self.duration_min = optimal_route.duration_min
        self.algorithm = optimal_route.algorithm
        self.compute_time_ms = getattr(optimal_route, 'compute_time_ms', 0)
        # Convert path to geojson format for compatibility
        if hasattr(optimal_route, 'path') and optimal_route.path:
            coordinates = [[coord[1], coord[0]] for coord in optimal_route.path]
            self.geojson = {"geometry": {"coordinates": coordinates}}
```

### **Error Handling**
- Primary: Use `alternative_routes()` with single route
- Fallback: Use original `route()` method if alternative approach fails
- Graceful degradation with proper error messages

## 🎯 **User Experience Impact**

### **Before Fix:**
- ❌ Toggle OFF → 404 Route Not Found error
- ❌ Inconsistent behavior between toggle states
- ❌ User confusion and frustration

### **After Fix:**
- ✅ Toggle OFF → Single optimal route displayed
- ✅ Toggle ON → Multiple alternative routes displayed  
- ✅ Consistent routing behavior
- ✅ Same enhanced adaptive algorithm in both modes
- ✅ Smooth user experience

## 🧪 **Testing**

Created `test_single_route_fix.py` to verify:
- ✅ Alternative routes API still works
- ✅ Single route API now works with same coordinates
- ✅ Both APIs return consistent results
- ✅ Toggle functionality works end-to-end

## 🎉 **Result**

Users can now seamlessly toggle between single and alternative route modes without encountering routing errors. Both modes use the same reliable routing engine with enhanced algorithms for optimal performance.
